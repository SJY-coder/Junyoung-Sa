Aerospace engineering student studying in Japan.

Introducing myself
======
 I am currently studying aerospace engineering at Kyushu University. I am an open, energetic person who is good at communication and teamwork and who continuously pursues improvement. My personal skills appear to be well-matched to  
• Ability to cooperate well in a team unit
• Possess proficiency in multiple languages and have the ability to assimilate into diverse cultures.
• Seeking continuous improvement in both ability and humanity sides

 As a leader of the Mine clearance squad in the Special Maneuver Supporting Brigade, South Korea, I have developed good communication and teamwork skills. Carrying out a demining operation in Siheung City has always been a high-tension environment to work in. Leading the squad from initializing & testing the metal detector (CMD V2) and detecting any kind of metal that could be a potential mine on a steep mountain required me to be able to collaborate and coordinate opinions while making strong discipline for zero-possibility of mistakes. 

 I am also a person who is regularly challenged with new goals to continuously develop. Following my military discharge, I took on an internship as flight control and avionics engineer at PLANA, a multinational company committed to the development of HeVTOL technology. Moreover, I have joined a joint research program with a university and an Australian company (Space Machines company) to optimize scramjet configuration via an evolutionary algorithm. Currently, I am pursuing my study to utilize PINN (Physics Informed Neural Network) to reduce computational cost during the optimization process by combining CFD data with governing physics laws.

 I would love to bring my teamwork, communication skills, and passion to solve problems in various ways to your organization.
